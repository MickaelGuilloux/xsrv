# Backups

Always keep 3 copies of valuable data (the working data, a local backup - preferably on another drive, and an off-site backup).

The [backup](roles/backup) role performs automatic daily/weekly/monthly backups of your data, to a local directory `/var/backups/rsnapshot` on the server.

To download a copy of latest daily backups from a host, to the `backups/` directory on the controller, run:

```bash
# for a single default playbook with a single host
xsrv fetch-backups
# for playbooks with multiple hosts
xsrv fetch-backups myplaybook my.CHANGEME.org
```

See each [role](#roles)'s documentation for information on how to restore backups.

Keep **off-line, off-site backups** of your `~/playbooks/` directory and user data.
