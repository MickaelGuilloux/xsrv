# Server preparation

## Hardware

The server (_host_) machine can be:
 - a physical computer (dedicated server, repurposed desktop/laptop, small factor board/barebone...)
 - a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) on your personal computer, at a VPS provider, or a dedicated/hardware hypervisor.

Virtualization software includes [libvirt/virt-manager](virt-manager.md) (Linux), [Proxmox VE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment) (hypervisor manager based on Debian and KVM), [Virtualbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox) (Linux/OSX/Windows)

Resource usage will vary depending on installed components (read each role's documentation), the number of users, and how much user data you need to store. Example minimal configuration for a personal/small team server with 2-10 users:

```
Computer with x86/64 compatible CPU
1024-2048+ MB RAM
10+ GB storage space for system and applications
1-âˆž GB storage space for user data
```

Use low power consumption components. To increase availability, setup the BIOS to reboot after a power loss, setup an [UPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uninterruptible_power_supply), and/or multiple power supplies.


## Network

The default configuration assumes the server has a single network interface.


### Internet access

The server must have Internet access during deployment and upgrades. Prefer fast and reliable network links. 


### NAT/port forwarding

If the network interface is in a [private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_addresses) behind a router, setup [port forwarding (NAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) on the router if you need to access your services from other networks/Internet.

Forward the following ports to your server's private IP address (if corresponding services are installed):

```
SSH server:                      TCP 22
Netdata monitoring system:       TCP 19999
Web server:                      TCP 80/443
BitTorrent incoming connections: TCP/UDP 52943
Mumble VoIP server:              TCP/UDP 64738
```

### Domain names

Clients (and the controller) must be able to resolve the server's IP address by its ([Fully Qualified Domain Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)). Separate domain or subdomain names are required for each service/application.

- Setup `A` or `CNAME` DNS records at a public [domain name registrar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar),
a [free subdomain service](https://freedns.afraid.org/domain/registry/) or on a [private DNS resolver](PFSENSE.md#dns).

By default the following subdomains are required (if corresponding roles are enabled):

```bash
***.CHANGEME.org # host name in the inventory/playbook
www.CHANGEME.org # homepage
cloud.CHANGEME.org # nextcloud
git.CHANGEME.org # gitea
links.CHANGEME.org # shaarli
rss.CHANGEME.org # tt-rss
torrent.CHANGEME.org # transmission
mumble.CHANGEME.org # mumble server
ldap.CHANGEME.org # openldap server/LDAP account manager
ssp.CHANGEME.org # LDAP self-service password
chat.CHANGEME.org # rocketchat
media.CHANGEME.org # jellyfin
logs.CHANGEME.org # graylog
tty.CHANGEME.org # gotty
```

_Alternatively, you can add [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29) entries on your client devices._

_Public DNS records are required to obtain Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS (HTTPS) certificates._


## Operating System

Roles in this collection are designed to run against minimal [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) [_Stable_](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianStable) systems: [Install Debian manually](DEBIAN.md) or use a preconfigured Debian installation image from your hosting provider.


## Ansible requirements

From the server console, login as `root` and run:

```bash
# install requirements for remote admin/ansible access
apt update && apt --no-install-recommends install python aptitude sudo openssh-server
# create a user account for remote administration (replace 'deploy' with the desired account name)
useradd --create-home --groups ssh,sudo --shell /bin/bash deploy
# set the sudo password for this user account
passwd deploy
# lock the console
logout
```

You should now [authorize your SSH key](controller-preparation.md) on the server.


## VM templates

At this point you may stop your newly created VM, and use it as a [template]((virt-manager.md#cloning-vms) for future deployments.
